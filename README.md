# Data Science Practices Repository

Welcome to my data science practices repository! This repository explores various data science practices based on Data Visualization & Analytics like Exploratory Data Analysis, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization with Power BI.

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files covering a range of data science practices. Here's a brief overview of what you can find:

1. **Practical-1**: Exploratory Data Analysis on a given dataset using Python.
2. **Practical-2**: Calculation of mean, median, and mode of the first 50 records in the dataset using Python.
3. **Practical-3**: Multiple Linear Regression on data.
4. **Practical-4**: Logistic Regression on a dataset.
5. **Practical-5**: K-means clustering to gain insights from data.
6. **Practical-6**: Decision tree classification algorithm using a dataset.
7. **Practical-7**: Study and installation of tools like Power BI for data Visualization.
8. **Practical-8**: Loading a dataset from different sources in Power BI and applying transformations.
9. **Practical-9**: Plotting various graphs for Data Visualization on Power BI.
10. **Practical-10**: Interactive Data Analytics with Power BI Dashboard - A case study.

## Contents

Each practical is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, providing detailed explanations and code examples for each practice.
